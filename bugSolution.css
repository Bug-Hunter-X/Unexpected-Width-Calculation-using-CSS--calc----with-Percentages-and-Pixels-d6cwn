The solution typically involves ensuring that the `calc()` function is consistently applied and adapts well to the dynamic size of the parent container. This often requires considering the `box-sizing` property and ensuring that padding, border, and margin are factored into the calculation.

Here's an example of a potential solution:

```css
.container {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the width calculation */
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
.parent {
  width: 100%; /*Ensure that the parent has defined width for correct calculation */
}
```

In this solution, `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures that the padding and border are included within the `width` calculation. It is also good practice to make sure that the parent container has a defined width (e.g., `width: 100%;`) to provide a stable context for the percentage calculation.
